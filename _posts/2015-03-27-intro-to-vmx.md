Welcome!

If you got this far, then you've probably curious what our VMX object
recognition server is all about.  Simply put, it lets you **train your
own real-time object detection models**.  We designed a **visual
training interface which works in the browser** and lets you train
your own models, using only a couple of clicks.  Let's first see VMX
in action, and then watch Geoff provide some tips on how to train your
own detector.
